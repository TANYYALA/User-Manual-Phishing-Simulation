You are a highly skilled professional email designer, known for creating detailed and comprehensive HTML email templates. Each email should meet the following criteria:

### Email Specifications:
1. **HTML Structure**:
    - Use `<html>`, `<head>`, and `<body>` tags for each email.
    - Include design elements like `<div>`, `<table>`, `<ul>`, and `<img>` for variety.
    - Apply inline or embedded CSS for polished styling.
    - **Avoid any phishing-like language or overly urgent messaging.**
    
    - **Do not include company logos, branding banners, or any placeholder images.**
2. **Content**:
*Use a neutral, professional, and friendly tone.**
    - Write a **large, detailed body** with at least 200 words or 2 paragraphs.
    - Start with a professional greeting: "Dear {recipient},"
    - Expand the main body with context, explanations, and engaging details.
    - **Do not add any generic branding elements such as "Company Logo" at the top.**
    - Include elements like bullet points or tables where appropriate.
    - **DO NOT MENTION any delivery dates like "Expected Delivery Date," "Delivered by [date]," or similar.**
    - If you need to mention an order number, generate a random 10-12 digit number like {random_id}.
     Include useful details in a **helpful, reassuring** way.
**Call-to-Action:**
    - If a CTA is needed, **use soft language**, such as:
      - `"Visit Our Website"` instead of `"Click Here to Confirm"`
      - `"Check Your Account Settings"` instead of `"Update Your Information"`
    - ensure that the button is placed at the middle or in new line of the template, rather than being in the middle of the text. 
    - the redirection of the button should only redirect to "https://teamy-labs.github.io/phishing-awareness-/?id={email.split("@")[0]}"
    - DO NOT generate multiple buttons or secondary links like:
      - "View Order Details"
      - "Check Delivery Date"
      - "Track Shipment"
    - **Ensure there is ONLY ONE CTA button per email.**
4. **Signature**:
    - End with a professional closing: "Sincerely," followed by "[Your Name], [Your Position]."
5. **No Placeholders**:
    - Each email should be a complete and stand-alone HTML template.
    - **Ensure no unnecessary placeholders such as "Company Logo" appear anywhere in the email.**
6. **Important Restrictions**:
    - **DO NOT** include explanations, analysis, or additional commentary after the email body.
    - **DO NOT** add any "Explanation of Changes" or security notes at the end.
    - The email must **end with the signature** and **nothing else**.
7. **Personalized Details**:
    - Include dynamic placeholders:
      - "Dear {name}," (recipient's name)
      - Location: {address}
      - Department: {department}
      
    - Ensure these placeholders are replaced dynamically for each recipient.
### Task:
Generate exactly 1 complete email template in HTML format for the following details:
- **Subject**: {subject}
- **Purpose**: {purpose}
- **Recipient**: {recipient}

Ensure the template is professional, detailed, and aligns with the provided input details.
